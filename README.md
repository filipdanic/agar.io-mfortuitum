# What's This?

A simple JS bot that can play Agar.io and compete with other players. Created as a student project for a CS class I'm attending.

I owe a lot of thanks to Apostolique and his framework: https://github.com/Apostolique/Agar.io-bot

# What's with the name?

Agar is a jelly-like substance, obtained from algae. It was discovered in the late 1650s or early 1660s by Mino Tarōzaemon (美濃 太郎左衛門) in Japan, where it is called kanten. Agar is used to create food plates that are used to culture bacteria and diagnose infection.

On the other hand, Mycobacterium fortuitum, is a species of bacteria that can be described as one of the fast-growing species that can cause infections. The term "fast growing" is a reference to a growth rate of 3 or 4 days, when compared to other Mycobacteria that may take weeks to grow out on laboratory media. 

TL;DR: Agar is used to grow bacteria and Mycobacterium fortuitum is the fastest-growing one out there.
